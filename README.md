# A Website for Done Manifesto

The Done Manifesto website hopes to present the contents of the manifesto and the works that were inspired by the manifesto in an interactive and fun way. The homepage presents a visual respresentation of the manifesto in the form of a puzzle game that can be completed. The purpose of the puzzle game representation is to allow the users to experience getting something done, which is the soul of this manifesto. The rest of the pages presents the manifesto itself and other representations of the manifesto, including the visual used in the puzzle game.

## About the manifesto

Done Manifesto was created in 20 minutes by [Bre Pettis](https://www.flickr.com/people/bre/) with [Kio Stark](http://www.kiostark.com/) in 2009. It pushes back against everything that might keep one from getting something done, such as procrastination, concerns, thoughts, situations, and unbridled creativity. This manifesto advocates for getting things done by listing out [13 ground rules](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bre/3326353804/in/photostream/) to get to done.
